        <h3 class="group-heading">What I do</h3>
        <p>I have 15+ years of experience designing user-interfaces for web and mobile applications, usually in the role of Senior Product Designer (or whichever label the industry deems fashionable at that given point).</p>

        <p>My career initially focused solely on design, but quickly started to include writing my own front-end templates and eventually turned into a combined role of design and front-end implementation, filling the gap between the design team and programmers.</p>

        <p>These days, having a deep understanding of front-end practices and limitations, makes my job as a designer a lot easier, and often leads to as shorter design- and implementation lifecycle.</p>

        <p class="lead font-italic">Within the last 5-6 years I have gradually transitioned into a clean product design role, spanning all the way from discovery and research, user-testing, planning, prototyping to designing and spec'ing for front-end handover.</p>

        <p>I strive for high quality, simplicity and take pride in what I do, while making an effort to influence and inspire colleagues and people around me. I love working with great people who push me to do deliver my best, but I am also very comfortable making decisions and executing projects alone.</p>


        <h3 class="group-heading">Location</h3>
        <p>My favorite base I keep returning to is Copenhagen, Denmark. I have traveled and worked remotely on multiple occasions as a consultant and full-time employee, and I'm a firm believer in letting people choose where they work most efficiently.</p>
