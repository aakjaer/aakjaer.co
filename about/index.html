                <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I'm Daniel AakjÃ¦r SÃ¸rensen. Currently, I'm working as a freelance consultant and co-founder of a secret eco-project in the Caribbean ðŸŒ´</a></p>

                <p class="lead">I am a designer, outdoorsman, entrepreneur, hobby photographer, vivid kitesurfer and in general enjoy the simple pleasures of life.</p>

        <p>I have 15+ years of experience designing user-interfaces for web and mobile applications, usually in the role of Senior Product Designer (or whichever label the industry deems fashionable at that given point).</p>

        <p>I strive for high quality, simplicity and take pride in what I do, while making an effort to influence and inspire colleagues and people around me to do the same. Building high quality and long-lasting products that are easy to maintain and hand over, has proven to be one of my most important strategies throughout my career.</p>

        <p>My favorite base I keep returning to is Copenhagen, Denmark. I have also traveled and worked remotely on multiple occasions as a consultant and full-time employee. I'm a firm believer in letting people choose where they work most efficiently.</p>
