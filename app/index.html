			<div class="teaser-text">
				<p>Throughout the last couple of years, I have been working intensively on perfecting the process of  delivering front-end prototypes, ready to hand on to the programmers/coders. Almost anyone who has ever experienced a web related project, knows the headaches and frustrations of dealing with the countless requirement and design changes, that are inevitable even with a fine-tuned workflow in a development team. My approach has been to build working prototypes reaping the following benefits:

				<ol>
					<li>A navigable static site where the client can get a real sense of the final look and feel, long before the actual site is implemented. This minimizes some of the misunderstadings between the projects participants (client/project manager, project manager/designer/developer etc.) and makes the UI/UX cycles much shorter.</li>
					<li>Instead of handing the programmers a set of PSD files or even simple HTML/CSS files for them to interpret, a working prototype provides a blueprint for the entire functionality of the website. Navigation, responsive behavior, reuse of code blocks, form feedback and messages, sets and combinations of content etc., working as building blocks for the programmers to merge their data into.</li>
					<li>Designers/front-enders need a playground/sandbox, to come up with new ideas, add new elements and modules and at the same time test that they are not breaking any existing features.</li>
				</ol>
