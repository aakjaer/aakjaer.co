        <p class="lead text-center">I was hired to redesign and reimplement the service-booking form from ground up, to convert more visitors into actual service bookings, focusing on making the process smooth on mobile devices.</p>

        <hr class="separator-blue">


        <p>The old sign-up flow was a very traditional, fairly unstyled, corparate looking, and way too many form fields, that I initially had to convince the client to optimize. My idea was to challange the existing somewhat conservative and restricted CI, while maintaining a calm and professional look/feel. Everything was build with a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>/<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> prototype with a trace of JS.</p>
